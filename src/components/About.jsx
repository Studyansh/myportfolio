                    I embarked my journey as a B.Tech Computer Science & Engineering student at Vel Tech Rangarajan Dr sagunthala R&D Institute of
                    Science and Technology College in 2022. Along the way, I fearlessly explored various fields, 
                    including Graphic Designing, Content Creation, and Sports filed. I delved into 
                    the world of cutting-edge technologies, such as React, Javascript and MongoDB.
